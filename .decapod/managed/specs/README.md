# Project Specs

Canonical path: `.decapod/managed/specs/`.
These files are the project-local contract for humans and agents.

## Snapshot
- Project: home-manager
- Outcome: To quickly bring up my Home Manager config first install Nix then
- Detected languages: shell
- Detected surfaces: shell

## How to use this folder
- [INTENT.md](./INTENT.md): what success means and what is explicitly out of scope.
- [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md): topology, runtime model, data boundaries, and ADR trail.
- [INTERFACES.md](./INTERFACES.md): API/CLI/events/storage contracts and failure behavior.
- [VALIDATION.md](./VALIDATION.md): proof commands, quality gates, and evidence artifacts.
- [SEMANTICS.md](./SEMANTICS.md): state machines, invariants, replay rules, and idempotency.
- [OPERATIONS.md](./OPERATIONS.md): SLOs, monitoring, incident response, and rollout strategy.
- [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md): threat model, trust boundaries, auth/authz, and supply-chain posture.

## Canonical `.decapod/` Layout
- `.decapod/data/`: canonical control-plane state (SQLite + ledgers).
- `.decapod/managed/Dockerfile.decapod`: Decapod's project-specific execution image; Decapod runs inside it and may add project build dependencies such as Go, Python, or system packages. Glibc is the default; `--image-profile alpine` selects the GHCR `-alpine`-tagged musl image.
- `.decapod/managed/specs/`: **Living project specs** for humans and agents.
- `Dockerfile` at the project root remains the product application's container image and is the artifact users package and deploy.
- `.decapod/managed/context/`: ignored, current-run deterministic context capsules.
- `.decapod/managed/policy/`: ignored, current-run JIT context policy material; use `.decapod/policy/` for a durable override.
- `.decapod/managed/artifacts/`: ignored, current-run provenance/custody/inventory/diagnostic outputs.
- `.decapod/governance/validation.json`: tracked per-commit validation receipt, overwritten after successful validation.
- `.decapod/governance/trajectory.json`: the single tracked run cookie; Git history preserves prior merged cookies.
- `.decapod/managed/artifacts/inventory/`: deterministic release inventory.
- `.decapod/managed/artifacts/diagnostics/`: opt-in diagnostics artifacts.
- `.decapod/workspaces/`: isolated todo-scoped git worktrees.

## Specification Status
- This directory is a set of reviewable contracts, not a generated status dump.
- Generated facts are bounded to the marked attestation/capability blocks; prose
  outside those blocks is authored project intent and must be reviewed like code.
- Each change should update the spec that owns its changed behavior and record
  the proof expected for that change.

## Per-Change Maintenance Loop
1. Identify the changed intent, component, interface, state transition, proof
   obligation, operational procedure, or trust boundary.
2. Update the owning spec before implementation is considered complete.
3. Record compatibility, migration, rollback, and evidence consequences.
4. Run the validation gates and refresh only the Decapod-owned attestation and
   manifest fields.
5. Review the resulting diff as part of the change; a fingerprint-only refresh
   is not a substitute for an authored contract update.

## Day-0 Onboarding Checklist
- [ ] Replace all placeholders in all 8 spec files.
- [ ] Confirm primary user outcome and acceptance criteria in [INTENT.md](./INTENT.md).
- [ ] Confirm topology and runtime model in [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).
- [ ] Document all inbound/outbound contracts in [INTERFACES.md](./INTERFACES.md).
- [ ] Define validation gates and CI proof surfaces in [VALIDATION.md](./VALIDATION.md).
- [ ] Define state machines and invariants in [SEMANTICS.md](./SEMANTICS.md).
- [ ] Define SLOs, alerting, and incident process in [OPERATIONS.md](./OPERATIONS.md).
- [ ] Define threat model and auth/authz decisions in [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).
- [ ] Ensure architecture diagram, docs, changelog, and tests are mapped to promotion gates.
- [ ] Run all validation/test commands and attach evidence artifacts.
