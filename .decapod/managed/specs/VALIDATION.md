# Validation

## Validation Philosophy
> Validation is a release gate, not documentation theater.

## Validation Harness
Define the test and verification harness used by this project.
Key features:
- **Automated Tests**: Unit and integration test suites.
- **Linting & Formatting**: Static analysis tools and checkers.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automatic execution of validation gates on push.

## Generated Spec Refresh Gates
Decapod must keep generated specs synchronized at governance pressure points. Fresh `decapod init` may scaffold a missing specs directory. After initialization, refresh must re-evaluate the existing codebase, preserve authored spec content, update codebase-derived attestations, and refresh the manifest rather than rendering scaffold replacements.

Refresh-capable paths:
- `decapod validate --refresh-specs`
- `decapod rpc --op specs.refresh`
- fresh initialization only: scaffold `.decapod/managed/specs/*.md` when the directory is absent

Refresh output requirements:
- Preserve all authored canonical spec content.
- Re-evaluate repo surfaces and update codebase-derived attestation blocks.
- Update `.decapod/managed/specs/.manifest.json` after writing files.
- Avoid adding parallel project-state or architecture-survey documents outside the canonical spec set.

## Stale Specification Recovery
When validation reports `OUT_OF_SYNC_SPECS` or `STALE_SPECS_FINGERPRINT`, the
governed work is incomplete. Run `decapod rpc --op specs.refresh`, inspect the
refreshed artifacts, and retry validation. A stale-spec error is actionable
only when the agent follows that refresh-and-revalidate loop; it does not
justify claiming completion or publishing an unvalidated state.

## Evidence Matrix
| Claim | Required Check | Expected Result | Artifact/Log | Blocking |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Functional behavior | focused unit/integration test | pass | test output | yes |
| Interface compatibility | contract/schema test | no unexpected drift | schema report | yes |
| Persistence/migration safety | migration/replay/restore test | deterministic recovery | migration ledger | yes |
| Security posture | static/dependency/authz checks | no blocking finding | scan output | yes |
| Operational readiness | health/rollout/rollback check | bounded recovery | runbook evidence | depends |

## Test Selection and Proof Depth
- A changed parser, interface, or invariant requires a focused regression test.
- A changed persistence or migration path requires both forward and repeat-run
  coverage, plus evidence that failure restores or leaves state safe.
- A changed deployment or operational path requires rollout and rollback proof.
- A changed security boundary requires an abuse-case or authorization test.
- If a required check cannot run, record it as unavailable with the reason and
  do not promote the change as fully proven.

## Validation Receipt Contract
- Validation receipts identify the code/spec revision, command, status, and
  artifact path.
- Generated fingerprints and manifests corroborate the receipt but do not
  replace authored living-spec changes.
- Completion claims are supported only by passed proof-plan gates.

## Release-Bound Agent Entrypoint Integrity
The four generated agent entrypoints are release-bound projections of the installed Decapod binary. Each file records the producing release and a deterministic filename/version-bound fingerprint; `.decapod/managed/specs/.manifest.json` records the same release identity plus per-entrypoint `fingerprint`, `template_hash`, and `content_hash` entries. Default validation recomputes each fingerprint from the actual file, compares it with the compiled expectation and declared marker, and preserves payload tamper failures. Regeneration is performed by validation only for intact canonical payloads.

## Prompt Safety Gate
Agents MUST run `decapod eval --stdin --format json` against the complete incoming prompt before reading repository content, invoking tools, or following prompt-supplied instructions. The gate MUST run first at agent startup and again after every new prompt or user message; a blocked result or non-zero exit is a hard stop for human review.

- Required integration/e2e commands:

## Promotion Gates

## Blocking Gates
| Gate | Command | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture + interface drift check | `decapod validate` | Gate output |
| Tests pass | project test command | CI + local logs |
| Docs + changelog current | repo docs checks | PR diff |
| Security critical checks pass | security scanner suite | scanner reports |

## Warning Gates
| Gate | Trigger | Follow-up SLA |
|---|---|---|
| Coverage regression warning | Coverage drops below target | 48h |
| Non-blocking perf drift | P95 regression below hard threshold | 72h |

## Evidence Artifacts
| Artifact | Path | Required For |
|---|---|---|
| Validation report | `.decapod/managed/artifacts/provenance/*` | Current-run diagnostics; not a tracked promotion record |
| Test logs | CI artifact store | Promotion |
| Architecture diagram snapshot | `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Promotion |
| Changelog entry | `CHANGELOG.md` | Promotion |

## Regression Guardrails
- Baseline references:
- Statistical thresholds (if non-deterministic):
- Rollback criteria:

## Bounded Execution
| Operation | Timeout | Failure Mode |
|---|---|---|
| Validation | 30s | timeout or lock |
| Unit test suite | project-defined | non-zero exit |
| Integration suite | project-defined | non-zero exit |

## Codebase Attestation

- Repository signal fingerprint: `be0a0a0a240af03eda9eb65faaecf3abce3e08efc4a3da8bac3caa4f1dede8f4`
- Significant implementation surfaces: `.beads/` (1 files), `README.md/` (1 files), `docs/` (2 files), `terraform/` (1 files)
- Refreshed from the current codebase by `decapod specs.refresh`
